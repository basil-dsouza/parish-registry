# Introduction
The objective of this project is to create a solution to record and utilize demographic information for a parish.
# Requirements
## Primary Factors
The main requirements that will shape the requirements are:
### Security
+ Due to sensitive nature of data collected, no unauthorized user should have access to this data to either read or write to it
### Safety
+ Data should be safe from destruction either mailiciously or accidentally
+ No modification should be allowed to the data, except via authenticated and authorized users making or reviewing it
### Ease of Access
+ Multiple users to enter data into a common data store
+ Should reduce the friction of gather parish information by allowing people to directly submit their details electronically (with appropriate review)
+ Should leverage the centralized datastore to allow for identifying relationships between data
### Ease of Operation
+ There is no dedicated tech team to support this software, so any operational processess should be automated
+ Steps to perform disaster recovery should be minimal and well documented
